# Machine-Vision-and-Intelligence
For the Machine Vision and Intelligence (MVI) assignment, our group developed a vision-based hand gesture recognition system using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The project aimed to accurately detect and classify hand gestures like finger counting, swiping, and hand orientation (left or right, palm or back). We utilized tools such as OpenCV for image processing, YOLOv8 for object detection, and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for gesture classification. Key features included detecting finger counts in real time, recognizing swipe gestures in various directions, and differentiating hand orientations.

Pedro Fabian Owono Ondo Mangue and Aravind Soundirarajan did most of the work, focusing on developing and refining key components like gesture recognition and machine learning integration. Their work ensured the system's accuracy and efficiency in real-time applications.
The system demonstrated high accuracy in real-time detection through machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset of hand motions, providing reliable gesture recognition applicable to various fields such as robotics, healthcare, and user interface design.
