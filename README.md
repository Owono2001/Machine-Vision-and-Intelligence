# Machine-Vision-and-Intelligence
For the Machine Vision and Intelligence (MVI) assignment, our group developed a vision-based hand gesture recognition system using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The project aimed to accurately detect and classify hand gestures like finger counting, swiping, and hand orientation (left or right, palm or back). We utilized tools such as OpenCV for image processing, YOLOv8 for object detection, and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for gesture classification. Our system's key features included detecting finger counts in real time, recognizing swipe gestures in various directions, and differentiating between hand orientations.

Each team member contributed to specific aspects of the project:

Aravind Soundirarajan worked on finger detection and counting.
Shokri Eyad Shokri Ouda focused on identifying hand swipe gestures (left, right, up, down).
Pedro Fabian Owono Ondo Mangue handled the detection of hand gestures like pinching, grabbing, rotation, and thumbs up.
Osama Ahmad Mustafa Mousa was responsible for recognizing hand orientation and differentiating between right and left hand, palm, and back.
The system demonstrated high accuracy in real-time detection through machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset of hand motions, providing reliable gesture recognition applicable to various fields such as robotics, healthcare, and user interface design.
